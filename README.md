# JAMB Faliure Rate Analysis

### Project Overview
this project aims to Investigate the Causes of JAMB Failure Rates and Predicting Future Trends (2020–2030)
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is a crucial standardized exam in Nigeria. In recent years, a noticeable rise in failure rates has raised concern.

### Data Source
raw data was sourced using the Google Forms to draft questionners for survey for students who took the JAMB exam in the year (2020–2025)

### Tools
- Google forms - for data collection
- Excel - for cleaning the data set
- Python - for analysing the data and predicting future trends

  ### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
   In the initial cleaning and preparation phase, we performed the followihg task:
- Data collection and inspection
- handling incomplete data
- data cleaning and formatting

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 EDA involved exploring the candidate to answer key questions like:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, State)
-	Academic background (School type, Exam year)
-	what was their JAMB score
- what was their Preparation methods & challenges
-	CBT familiarity & technical issues
-	Self-reported confidence

### Data Analysis

include some interesting code/features worked with

```python
PRINT('JAMB_pass_rate_forecast')
PRINT('pass_rate'),
```

### Result/Findings
- 45% overall average success rate
-	Highest scores generally range from 150–250
Factors Affecting Performance:
-	Higher success among private school students
-	Confidence level strongly correlated with performance
-	Major challenges: CBT issues, lack of preparation resources

  ### Recommendation
  - Practice with CBT platforms & mock tests
  - Join study groups or seek online prep suppor
  - Increase student access to structured prep programs
  - Train students on digital exam platforms
  - Improve CBT infrastructure nationwide
  - Provide subsidized prep tools for disadvantaged students
  - Regularly review and modernize JAMB syllabus

### Limitations

- Incomplete survey responses
- Small sample size
- Vague or subjective answers
- Encoding categorical features
